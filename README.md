# DataStructures-CPP

A Data Structure is a named location that can be used to store and organize data and, an Algorithm is a collection of steps to solve a particular problem. <br>
Learning data structures and algorithms allow us to write efficient and optimized computer programs.<br>
This is my journey of learning Data Structures in C/C++.
